# Hangman-Game
a text game of the classic pass-time game: Hangman

## Description
This game will allow the user to choose a catergory based on the word list supplied, and then will be able to try and guess the word that is choosen from said list. As the user gets incorrect answers, the game will keep track of what was choosen and can reflect to the user how many chances they have left
Future lists can be added or modified and just requires the 'elif' loop to be extended upon so that user can use said list. 

This was just a passing game that was amde and dont plan on making any changes to it in the future.
